## Medicine Delivery System
* Suppose there are n delivery points in a city, and we have to efficiently deliver some medicines.
* These n points are the network of running intra-city buses (in a way it should be effective than Google maps).
* Next step is to add dynamic weights between these points, weights can be given considering the distance, charge, traffic etc.
  > Dynamic weights can be added using Geocoding and Geolocation(Python). 
* Next step to apply a suitable MST algorithm.
* Our main aim is to minimize the cost of delivering medicines accross these points.
